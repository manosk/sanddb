     * Logic to reclaim nodes 'deleted' as a result of pop()
     *
     * In high-load situations, there may never be such a quiescent state, because other
     * threads have entered pop() before all the threads initially in pop() have left.
     * Under such a scenario, the to_be_deleted list would grow without bounds,
     * and you'd be essentially leaking memory again.
     * If there aren't going to be any quiescent periods,
     * you need to find an alternative mechanism for reclaiming the nodes.
     * The key is to identify when no more threads are accessing a particular node
     * so that it can be reclaimed.
     * By far the easiest such mechanism to reason about is the use of hazard pointers.
